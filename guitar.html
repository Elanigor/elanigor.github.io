      <header><h2>Preface</h2></header>
          <p>&nbsp; Let me start by saying thank you for using this book as a study aid to further  your understanding of the guitar.  </p>
          <p>&nbsp; I would also like to mention that this guide is not intended to replace or 
diminish the value of instruction from a qualified music instructor. This 
publication has been written to provide a reference to guitarists on the 
fundamental theories that most modern, commercial music is created with. If 
anything, this publication has been created with with intent to augment the 
experience by keeping all of this information close at hand and logically 
organized. </p> 
          <p>&nbsp; Please do not, even for a moment, think that the information in this book is  intended to be comprehensive and/or all encompassing, these are quite simply  the concepts I wish I’d had a better understanding of, earlier in my musical  journey. There are plenty of books available to go deeper into specific topics,  written by people with much more impressive credentials than my own. If you  should come across something that is particularly interesting, I will provide  suggestions, and we can certainly dig a little deeper into that specific topic. </p> 
          <p>&nbsp; I’d like to add that no amount of theoretical knowledge can trump just playing  and listening to other musicians. These concepts are just the language that we  use to communicate our ideas and thoughts. Also, they provide a map of  movements we can safely make when navigating the musical landscape. That  said, when we have a grasp on these concepts, and I mean when they have  become second nature, then we can just play. The music we play becomes  conversational once we learn the language. In short, learn as much of the  catalogue of the artists you admire as you can. Learn as much music in other  genres as you can as well. This is how we develop our individual voices on the  guitar. </p> 
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most of all, have fun,  </p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lou.</p>

      <h3 id="what is a scale">What's a scale?</h3>
        <p> &nbsp;In music, we have notes. Notes are how we describe the various frequencies 
or pitches musical instruments produce. We give letter names to each of the 
notes based on the <strong>musical alphabet</strong>. In western music, the musical alphabet 
          is as follows; <strong>A B C D E F G</strong>. On your guitar, these notes are here; </p>
      <p class="tab">E|-----------------------------------0--1--3--5--</p>
      <p class="tab">B|--------------------------0--1--3--------------</p>
      <p class="tab">G|--------------------0--2-----------------------</p>
      <p class="tab">D|-----------0--2--3-----------------------------</p>
      <p class="tab">A|--0--2--3--------------------------------------</p>
      <p class="tab">E|-----------------------------------------------</p>
      <p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C &nbsp;D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F &nbsp;G &nbsp;A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C &nbsp;D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F &nbsp;G &nbsp;A</p>
      
      <!-- record and add A minor scale as is shown under the name "aMinorLarge" -->
      <!-- split recording when you hit high A under the name "aMinor" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="aMinorLarge.mp3"></audio> -->
      
      <p>As you can see from this example, the notes continue to cycle through the note 
names although raising in pitch. But, how can this be? As the frequency or pitch 
of a note doubles, it creates what is referred to as an octave. Each octave is 
divided into 12 semitones, a semitone is the space from one fret to the next. </p>
      <p class="tab">E|--------------------------------------------</p>
      <p class="tab">B|--------------------------------------------</p>
      <p class="tab">G|--------------------------------------------</p>
      <p class="tab">D|--------------------------------------------</p>

      <p class="tab">E|--0--1--2--3--4--5--6--7--8--9--10--11--12--</p>

      <!-- record and add chromatic scale starting on E as is shown under the name "eChromatic" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="eChromatic.mp3"></audio> -->
      
       <p>From these twelve semitones, we create a series of <strong>whole tone</strong> and <strong>half tone
          steps</strong>. If we refer to our example again, it shows us that the space between <strong>B</strong> 
          and <strong>C</strong> notes as well as <strong>E</strong> and <strong>F</strong> notes are half tones (1 fret), and the space 
between all of the other notes are whole tones (2 frets). This arrangement of the 
          <strong>natural</strong> notes on your guitar creates a 7 note scale. </p>
<p>So, to summarize what we’ve learned so far, a scale is a series of notes built 
  around a fundamental frequency, the “<strong>R</strong>oot” or “<strong>T</strong>onic”, ordered in a series of 
whole tones and half tones. What we do with these notes next is where the 
magic happens. Depending on the order in which we play these notes, they 
create different qualities, or “moods”. The first two scale types we will focus on 
will be the major scale and the minor scale. 
        </p>
      <h3 id="how are they built">How are they built?</h3>
        <p> &nbsp;Lets start by talking about the major scale, more specifically, C major scale. If 
we were to play all of the notes of the musical alphabet starting on C, and 
finishing on C, that gives us a C major scale. </p>
<p> &nbsp; C major scale 1 octave &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C major scale 1 octave across 1 string</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">B|--------------------------|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">G|--------------------4--5--|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">D|-----------3--5--7--------|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">A|--3--5--7-----------------|--3--5--7--8--10--12--14--15--</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; C &nbsp;D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F &nbsp;G &nbsp;A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C &nbsp; &nbsp; C &nbsp;D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F &nbsp;G &nbsp;A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C</p>
<p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H</p>

      <!-- record and add C major scale as is shown under the name "cMajor" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="cMajor.mp3"></audio> -->
      <!-- record and add C major scale as is shown under the name "cMajorOneString" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="cMajorOneString.mp3"></audio> -->
      
      <p> &nbsp;Notice in the example that the “steps” are marked under the note names. This 
is an important consideration when we start to learn the major scale in other 
<strong>keys</strong>. We rarely use the major scale as it is written, across one string, I’ve used 
this to illustrate <strong>W</strong>hole and <strong>H</strong>alf step <strong>Intervals</strong>. Although, this will come in 
handy later when we talk about triads. </p>
<p>So, to summarize , the major scale is built, from its <strong>Root</strong>, using; <strong>WWHWWWH</strong> as its intervallic formula. It is a Diatonic scale, therefore its made of 7 notes. </p>
<p>Lets move on to the darker, more melancholy cousin of the major scale, the 
minor scale. Now that we know the notes of C major, its formula, and are 
familiar with its sound, let’s take a look at its <strong>relative minor</strong>, A minor. </p>
<p> &nbsp; A minor scale1 octave open POS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A minor scale 1 octave 5th POS</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">B|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">G|--------------------0--2--|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">D|-----------0--2--3--------|--------------------5--7--</p>
<p class="tab">A|--0--2--3-----------------|-----------5--7--8--------</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|--5--7--8-----------------</p>
<p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C &nbsp;D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F &nbsp;G &nbsp;A &nbsp; &nbsp; A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C &nbsp;D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F &nbsp;G &nbsp;A</p>
<p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W</p>

      <!-- <audio controls><source src="aMinor.mp3"></audio> -->
      <!-- rerecord A minor as shown under "aMinorFifthPos" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="aMinorFifthPos.mp3"></audio> -->
      
      <p>As you can see, the notes stay the same, but are played in a different order. 
The <strong>relative minor</strong> is made of the same notes as its major cousin, only 
starting on the 6th <strong>degree</strong>, or the 6th note of the major scale. </p>
<p>In summary; the minor scale is built upon the 6th degree of its relative major, 
its formula, from the root, is <strong>WHWWHWW</strong></p>
      <h3 id="the major scale">The Major Scale</h3>
        <p> &nbsp;So, we have learned that all major scales follow the same formula from their 
root note, WWHWWWH. This creates a very convenient approach to learning 
major scales on the guitar because we have a series of repeating patterns all 
across the fretboard. As long as we follow the scale formula, we have a major 
scale.</p>
    <p>Let’s look at G major;</p>
    <p> &nbsp; G major scale 1 octave &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;G major scale 1 octave across 1 string</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">B|--------------------------|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">G|--------------------------|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">D|-----------------2--4--5--|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">A|--------2--3--5-----------|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">E|--3--5--------------------|--3--5--7--8--10--12--14--15--</p>
<p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; G &nbsp;A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C &nbsp;D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F#&nbsp;G &nbsp; &nbsp; G &nbsp;A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C &nbsp;D &nbsp; E &nbsp; F# &nbsp;G</p>
<p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H</p>
    
      <!-- record and add G major scale as is shown under the name "gMajor" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="gMajor.mp3"></audio> -->
      <!-- record and add G major scale as is shown under the name "gMajorOneString" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="gMajorOneString.mp3"></audio> -->
      
      <p>Notice how the pattern stays the same as C maj, only down 1 string? There is an 
obvious difference in the example that is played across the strings. In this 
example, the third note is played up a string and a fret behind the root. If we 
take a look at the previous example, ex.3, you can clearly see that the third note 
is played 4 frets above on the same string. As long as it adds up to 2 full steps, 
it is a major 3rd, or M3. This is the interval that defines the major sound. </p>
    <p>Another notable feature of Gmaj is the 7th note. As you will notice, it has been 
changed from F to F#. This change is what puts us into the key of G. Remember 
that maj scale formula we discussed earlier? By “sharping” the F note, we have 
corrected our formula to make a G maj scale. 
Let’s look at D major; </p>
    <p> &nbsp; D major scale 1 octave &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; D major scale 1 octave across 1 string</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|-------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">B|--------------------------|-------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">G|--------------------------|-------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">D|-----------------4--5--7--|-------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">A|--------4--5--7-----------|-------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">E|--5--7--------------------|--5--7--9--10--12--14--16--17--</p>
<p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F#&nbsp;G &nbsp;A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C#&nbsp;D &nbsp; &nbsp; D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F#&nbsp;G &nbsp;A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C#&nbsp;D</p>
<p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H</p>
    
      <!-- record and add D major scale as is shown under the name "dMajor" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="dMajor.mp3"></audio> -->
      <!-- record and add D major scale as is shown under the name "dMajorOneString" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="dMajorOneString.mp3"></audio> -->
      
      <p>And again, for D major, the pattern remains the same, as does the scale 
formula. The differences are what notes we use to create our scale. Once again 
in this example, we've sharped the 7th degree in order to maintain the major 
scale formula. We can continue creating keys until we run out of sharps by 
rewriting our scale from the 5th degree and sharping the new 7th. </p>
    <p>It’s through this process of moving through the keys that we have created key 
      signatures and can express them by <strong>order of sharps</strong>. More on this later.</p>
    
      <h3 id="the minor scale">The Minor Scale</h3>
        <p>So, we’ve learned that the major scale has a very specific series of intervals, and 
that those intervals are always the same. We alter the spacing, and order of the 
notes to create different keys. The same can be said for the minor scale. The 
formula is as follows, WHWWHWW from root to octave. This is the formula for a 
          <strong>Natural Minor</strong> scale.</p>
    <p> &nbsp;There are two ways in which to build a natural minor scale, <strong>Relative Minor</strong> or 
      <strong>Parallel Minor</strong>. When we refer to a <em>relative</em> minor, what we have is the natural 
minor scale, built from the 6th degree of any major scale, ie; A minor is made of 
the same notes as C major, only starting on A.</p>
  <p>When we refer to a <em>Parallel</em> minor scale, we are altering the notes of a major 
scale to create a minor scale built on the same Tonic, or root note. For example, 
    lets look at C major. By simply <em>flatting</em> the 3rd , 6th and 7th degrees of our major 
scale, what we end up with is the C natural minor scale. The notes become C, D, 
Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Which equates to a relative major key of Eb, which is built as 
follows; Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D.</p>
            <p> &nbsp; C maj scale. C, D, E, F, G, A, B &nbsp; &nbsp; C minor scale(b3, b6, b7), C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">B|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">G|--------------------4--5--|--------------------3--5--</p>
<p class="tab">D|-----------3--5--7--------|-----------3--5--6--------</p>
<p class="tab">A|--3--5--7-----------------|--3--5--6-----------------</p>

      <!-- record and add C minor scale as is shown under the name "cMinor" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="cMinor.mp3"></audio> -->
      
      
        <p>So, that was how to change C major to C minor, lets take a look at the key G;</p>
            <p> &nbsp;G major scale, G, A, B, C, D, E, F# &nbsp;G minor scale(b3, b6, b7) G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F</p>

      <!-- record and add G minor scale as is shown under the name "gMinor" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="gMinor.mp3"></audio> -->
      
        <p>Lets look at the key of D;</p>
        <p> &nbsp;D major scale, D, E, F#, G, A, B, C# &nbsp;D minor, (b3, b6, b7)D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C</p>

      <!-- record and add D minor scale as is shown under the name "dMinor" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="dMinor.mp3"></audio> -->
      
        <p>Now for the relative minor keys of the major keys we’ve learned about;</p>
        <p> &nbsp;E minor scale (Relative minor of G maj) &nbsp;B minor (Relative minor of D maj)</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">B|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">G|--------------------------|--------------------2--4--</p>
<p class="tab">D|--------------------0--2--|-----------2--4--5--------</p>
<p class="tab">A|-----------0--2--3--------|--2--4--5-----------------</p>

      <!-- record and add B minor scale as is shown under the name "bMinor" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="bMinor.mp3"></audio> -->
      
        <p>Now, try creating some parallel minor scales, and then figuring out their relative 
majors with this concept.</p>
        
      <h3 id="intervals the space between">Intervals, the Space Between</h3>
        <p>&nbsp; So, by this point in your studies, we’ve established that the major scale and its slightly 
depressed cousin the minor scale have a completely different sound and feel, even 
when they are made of the same notes (relative Maj/min.). Why is this? What you are 
hearing is the difference in distance from the Tonic (C in Cmaj, A in Amin) to the 3rd 
note in that scale type. (E is the Maj 3rd of Cmaj, C is the min 3rd of Amin)</p>
      <p> &nbsp;C Maj &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A min &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C min</p>
<p class="tab">E|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------</p>
<p class="tab">B|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------</p>
<p class="tab">G|-------------4-5-|-----------------|-------------3-5-</p>
<p class="tab">D|-------3-5-7-----|-------------5-7-|-------3-5-6-----</p>
<p class="tab">A|-3-5-7-----------|-------5-7-8-----|-3-5-6-----------</p>
<p class="tab">E|-----------------|-5-7-8-----------|-----------------</p>
      
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="cMajor.mp3"></audio> -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="aMinor.mp3"></audio> -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="cMinor.mp3"></audio> -->
      
      <p>&nbsp; Notice the “<strong>steps</strong>” from C to E in Cmaj, from A to C in Amin, and C to Eb in Cmin?
        There are <strong>2</strong> whole steps from C to E, this makes a <strong>Major 3rd (M3)</strong>, whereas A to C 
        only adds up to 1 and 1/2 steps, which creates a <strong>minor 3rd, (m3)</strong>. Notice how the Eb 
(3rd note in Cmin) creates the same condition only in relation to C. We’ve 
        accomplished this by <em>flatting</em> the third, thereby creating a <strong>m3</strong> interval. This is the first 
of many intervals that can change the quality or mood of a melody or chord.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; Now that we have established that the 3rd creates the the strongest indication of a 
Major or minor quality, and we understand that it is due to the distance from note to 
note, take a look at the examples above and get familiar with the other intervals. 
        Notice that <strong>2,3,6,7</strong> are considered Major (<strong>M</strong>) or minor (<strong>m</strong>), Tonic (<strong>T</strong>) and Octave (<strong>Oct</strong>) 
        are the same note, 12 semitones apart, And the <strong>4th</strong> and <strong>5th</strong> are either perfect (<strong>P</strong>), 
        raised (<strong>Aug</strong>), or lowered (<strong>dim</strong>) one semitone. You will also notice the the Major and 
Natural Minor scales have a perfect 4 and perfect 5. We will move these around later 
to see what effect they have on quality of scale or chord sounds. </p>
      <p>The next interval we will discuss is the <strong>5th</strong> degree of our scale. A perfect 5th is <strong>3 1/2</strong>
        steps above the <strong>T</strong>onic or <strong>R</strong>oot . You will notice that when we count up 5 notes from 
any scale degree, except the 7th degree (B in the Key of C), of the major scale, we 
have a perfect fifth interval. (C to G, D to A, E to B etc.) On the 7th,(B to F), this creates 
        a <storng>3</strong> step interval that we refer to as a <strong>b5</strong>, or <strong>dim5</strong>. </p>
      <p>With this understanding of these 2 intervals, we can now move on to triads. </p>

        <p>&nbsp; Now that we have familiarized ourselves with the effect of intervals on the quality or 
”mood” of a harmony, lets a see what happens when we harmonize the Major scale. 
What this means is that we will stack the R,3,5, for every note in the Major scale. What 
this accomplishes is that we can clearly understand what chords to use to be in the 
correct key for the song or part.</p>
      <!-- There is a lot of tricky text that goes right where this comment is, and I would rather do it later than now. -->
      <p>These are the triad <strong>Chords</strong> in C. We can also play our triads broken, we call 
these arpeggios.</p>
      <!-- Again, tricky text. This time it is easier, just a bit of sheet music. -->
      
      <!-- record and add C major arpeggio as is shown under the name "cMajorArp" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="cMajorArp.mp3"></audio> -->
      
      <!-- record and add D minor arpeggio as is shown under the name "dMinorArp" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="dMinorArp.mp3"></audio> -->
      
      <!-- record and add E minor arpeggio as is shown under the name "eMinorArp" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="eMinorArp.mp3"></audio> -->
      
      <!-- record and add F major arpeggio as is shown under the name "fMajorArp" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="fMajorArp.mp3"></audio> -->
      
      <!-- record and add G major arpeggio as is shown under the name "gMajorArp" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="gMajorArp.mp3"></audio> -->
      
      <!-- record and add A minor arpeggio as is shown under the name "aMinorArp" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="aMinorArp.mp3"></audio> -->
      
      <!-- record and add B diminished arpeggio as is shown under the name "bDimArp" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="bDimArp.mp3"></audio> -->
      
      <!-- record and add C major arpeggio as is shown (one octave up) under the name "cMajorArpHigh" -->
      <!-- <audio controls><source src="cMajorArpHigh.mp3"></audio> -->
      
      <p>Another way we can use triads is by rearranging the notes to create more interesting 
        <strong>voicings</strong>. This is accomplished by using <strong>inversions</strong>. So far we have studied root 
position or Inv.1 chords. Now, let’s rearrange those notes and see what effect it has on 
the sound of our chords. As we learned in the previous section, triads are created 
when we harmonize the <strong>R,3rd,5th,</strong> of any given scale, or any scale degree. Lets 
rearrange </p>
