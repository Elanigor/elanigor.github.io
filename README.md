# lou-theory-site
repository for lou's website for guitar theory

This project will be just two people, me and sir louis, the html and style files are self-explanitory. The website will be built to distribute information written by lou to teach basic guitar theory.

There will also be other sections such as drums that will be added in the future

This site uses Vextab, a great piece of code for integrating sheet music into html https://vexflow.com/vextab/
