      <header><h2>Preface</h2></header>
      <p>
          Let me start by saying thank you for using this book as a study aid to further  your understanding of the guitar.  </p>
          <p>I would also like to mention that this guide is not intended to replace or  diminish the value of instruction from a qualified music instructor. This  publication has been written to provide a reference to guitarists on the  fundamental theories that most modern, commercial music is created with. If  anything, this publication has been created with with intent to augment the  experience by keeping all of this information close at hand and logically  organized. </p> 
          <p>Please do not, even for a moment, think that the information in this book is  intended to be comprehensive and/or all encompassing, these are quite simply  the concepts I wish I’d had a better understanding of, earlier in my musical  journey. There are plenty of books available to go deeper into specific topics,  written by people with much more impressive credentials than my own. If you  should come across something that is particularly interesting, I will provide  suggestions, and we can certainly dig a little deeper into that specific topic. </p> 
          <p>I’d like to add that no amount of theoretical knowledge can trump just playing  and listening to other musicians. These concepts are just the language that we  use to communicate our ideas and thoughts. Also, they provide a map of  movements we can safely make when navigating the musical landscape. That  said, when we have a grasp on these concepts, and I mean when they have  become second nature, then we can just play. The music we play becomes  conversational once we learn the language. In short, learn as much of the  catalogue of the artists you admire as you can. Learn as much music in other  genres as you can as well. This is how we develop our individual voices on the  guitar. </p> 
      <p>Most of all, have fun,  </p>
      <p>Lou.</p>

      <h3 id="what is a scale">What's a scale?</h3>
        <p> &nbsp;In music, we have notes. Notes are how we describe the various frequencies 
or pitches musical instruments produce. We give letter names to each of the 
notes based on the <strong>musical alphabet</strong>. In western music, the musical alphabet 
          is as follows; <strong>A B C D E F G</strong>. On your guitar, these notes are here; </p>
      <p class="tab">E|-----------------------------------0--1--3--5--</p>
      <p class="tab">B|--------------------------0--1--3--------------</p>
      <p class="tab">G|--------------------0--2-----------------------</p>
      <p class="tab">D|-----------0--2--3-----------------------------</p>
      <p class="tab">A|--0--2--3--------------------------------------</p>
      <p class="tab">E|-----------------------------------------------</p>
      <p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C &nbsp;D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F &nbsp;G &nbsp;A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C &nbsp;D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F &nbsp;G &nbsp;A</p>
<p>As you can see from this example, the notes continue to cycle through the note 
names although raising in pitch. But, how can this be? As the frequency or pitch 
of a note doubles, it creates what is referred to as an octave. Each octave is 
divided into 12 semitones, a semitone is the space from one fret to the next. </p>
      <p class="tab">E|--------------------------------------------</p>
      <p class="tab">B|--------------------------------------------</p>
      <p class="tab">G|--------------------------------------------</p>
      <p class="tab">D|--------------------------------------------</p>
      <p class="tab">A|--------------------------------------------</p>
      <p class="tab">E|--0--1--2--3--4--5--6--7--8--9--10--11--12--</p>
      <p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; E &nbsp;F &nbsp;F# G &nbsp;G# A &nbsp;A# B &nbsp;C &nbsp;C# D &nbsp; D# &nbsp;E</p>
      </p>
       <p>From these twelve semitones, we create a series of <strong>whole tone</strong> and <strong>half tone
          steps</strong>. If we refer to our example again, it shows us that the space between <strong>B</strong> 
          and <strong>C</strong> notes as well as <strong>E</strong> and <strong>F</strong> notes are half tones (1 fret), and the space 
between all of the other notes are whole tones (2 frets). This arrangement of the 
          <strong>natural</strong> notes on your guitar creates a 7 note, or <strong>diatonic</strong> scale. </p>
<p>So, to summarize what we’ve learned so far, a scale is a series of notes built 
around a fundamental frequency, the “root” or “tonic”, ordered in a series of 
whole tones and half tones. What we do with these notes next is where the 
magic happens. Depending on the order in which we play these notes, they 
create different qualities, or “moods”. The first two scale types we will focus on 
will be the major scale and the minor scale. 
        </p>
      <h3 id="how are they built">How are they built?</h3>
        <p> &nbsp;Lets start by talking about the major scale, more specifically, C major scale. If 
we were to play all of the notes of the musical alphabet starting on C, and 
finishing on C, that gives us a C major scale. </p>
<p> &nbsp; C major scale 1 octave &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C major scale 1 octave across 1 string</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">B|--------------------------|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">G|--------------------4--5--|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">D|-----------3--5--7--------|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">A|--3--5--7-----------------|--3--5--7--8--10--12--14--15--</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; C &nbsp;D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F &nbsp;G &nbsp;A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C &nbsp; &nbsp; C &nbsp;D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F &nbsp;G &nbsp;A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C</p>
<p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H</p>
<p> &nbsp;Notice in the example that the “steps” are marked under the note names. This 
is an important consideration when we start to learn the major scale in other 
<strong>keys</strong>. We rarely use the major scale as it is written, across one string, I’ve used 
this to illustrate <strong>W</strong>hole and <strong>H</strong>alf step <strong>Intervals</strong>. Although, this will come in 
handy later when we talk about triads. </p>
<p>So, to summarize , the major scale is built, from its <strong>Root</strong>, using; <strong>WWHWWWH</strong> as its intervallic formula. It is a Diatonic scale, therefore its made of 7 notes. </p>
<p>Lets move on to the darker, more melancholy cousin of the major scale, the 
minor scale. Now that we know the notes of C major, its formula, and are 
familiar with its sound, let’s take a look at its <strong>relative minor</strong>, A minor. </p>
<p> &nbsp; A minor scale1 octave open POS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A minor scale 1 octave 5th POS</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">B|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">G|--------------------0--2--|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">D|-----------0--2--3--------|--------------------5--7--</p>
<p class="tab">A|--0--2--3-----------------|-----------5--7--8--------</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|--5--7--8-----------------</p>
<p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C &nbsp;D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F &nbsp;G &nbsp;A &nbsp; &nbsp; A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C &nbsp;D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F &nbsp;G &nbsp;A</p>
<p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W</p>
<p>As you can see, the notes stay the same, but are played in a different order. 
The <strong>relative minor</strong> is made of the same notes as its major cousin, only 
starting on the 6th <strong>degree</strong>, or the 6th note of the major scale. </p>
<p>In summary; the minor scale is built upon the 6th degree of its relative major, 
its formula, from the root, is <strong>WHWWHWW</strong></p>
      <h3 id="the major scale">The Major Scale</h3>
        <p> &nbsp;So, we have learned that all major scales follow the same formula from their 
root note, WWHWWWH. This creates a very convenient approach to learning 
major scales on the guitar because we have a series of repeating patterns all 
across the fretboard. As long as we follow the scale formula, we have a major 
scale.</p>
    <p>Let’s look at G major;</p>
    <p> &nbsp; G major scale 1 octave &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;G major scale 1 octave across 1 string</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">B|--------------------------|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">G|--------------------------|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">D|-----------------2--4--5--|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">A|--------2--3--5-----------|------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">E|--3--5--------------------|--3--5--7--8--10--12--14--15--</p>
<p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; G &nbsp;A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C &nbsp;D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F#&nbsp;G &nbsp; &nbsp; G &nbsp;A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C &nbsp;D &nbsp; E &nbsp; F# &nbsp;G</p>
<p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H</p>
    <p>Notice how the pattern stays the same as C maj, only down 1 string? There is an 
obvious difference in the example that is played across the strings. In this 
example, the third note is played up a string and a fret behind the root. If we 
take a look at the previous example, ex.3, you can clearly see that the third note 
is played 4 frets above on the same string. As long as it adds up to 2 full steps, 
it is a major 3rd, or M3. This is the interval that defines the major sound. </p>
    <p>Another notable feature of Gmaj is the 7th note. As you will notice, it has been 
changed from F to F#. This change is what puts us into the key of G. Remember 
that maj scale formula we discussed earlier? By “sharping” the F note, we have 
corrected our formula to make a G maj scale. 
Let’s look at D major; </p>
    <p> &nbsp; D major scale 1 octave &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; D major scale 1 octave across 1 string</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|-------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">B|--------------------------|-------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">G|--------------------------|-------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">D|-----------------4--5--7--|-------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">A|--------4--5--7-----------|-------------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">E|--5--7--------------------|--5--7--9--10--12--14--16--17--</p>
<p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F#&nbsp;G &nbsp;A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C#&nbsp;D &nbsp; &nbsp; D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F#&nbsp;G &nbsp;A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C#&nbsp;D</p>
<p class="tab descriptor"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;W &nbsp;H</p>
    <p>And again, for D major, the pattern remains the same, as does the scale 
formula. The differences are what notes we use to create our scale. Once again 
in this example, we've sharped the 7th degree in order to maintain the major 
scale formula. We can continue creating keys until we run out of sharps by 
rewriting our scale from the 5th degree and sharping the new 7th. </p>
    <p>It’s through this process of moving through the keys that we have created key 
      signatures and can express them by <strong>order of sharps</strong>. More on this later.</p>
    
      <h3 id="the minor scale">The Minor Scale</h3>
        <p>So, we’ve learned that the major scale has a very specific series of intervals, and 
that those intervals are always the same. We alter the spacing, and order of the 
notes to create different keys. The same can be said for the minor scale. The 
formula is as follows, WHWWHWW from root to octave. This is the formula for a 
          <strong>Natural Minor</strong> scale.</p>
    <p> &nbsp;There are two ways in which to build a natural minor scale, <strong>Relative Minor</strong> or 
      <strong>Parallel Minor</strong>. When we refer to a <em>relative</em> minor, what we have is the natural 
minor scale, built from the 6th degree of any major scale, ie; A minor is made of 
the same notes as C major, only starting on A.</p>
  <p>When we refer to a <em>Parallel</em> minor scale, we are altering the notes of a major 
scale to create a minor scale built on the same Tonic, or root note. For example, 
    lets look at C major. By simply <em>flatting</em> the 3rd , 6th and 7th degrees of our major 
scale, what we end up with is the C natural minor scale. The notes become C, D, 
Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. Which equates to a relative major key of Eb, which is built as 
follows; Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D.</p>
            <p> &nbsp; C maj scale. C, D, E, F, G, A, B &nbsp; &nbsp; C minor scale(b3, b6, b7), C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">B|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">G|--------------------4--5--|--------------------3--5--</p>
<p class="tab">D|-----------3--5--7--------|-----------3--5--6--------</p>
<p class="tab">A|--3--5--7-----------------|--3--5--6-----------------</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
        <p>So, that was how to change C major to C minor, lets take a look at the key G;</p>
            <p> &nbsp;G major scale, G, A, B, C, D, E, F# &nbsp;G minor scale(b3, b6, b7) G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">B|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">G|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">D|--------------------4--5--|--------------------3--5--</p>
<p class="tab">A|-----------3--5--7--------|-----------3--5--6--------</p>
<p class="tab">E|--3--5--7-----------------|--3--5--6-----------------</p>
        <p>Lets look at the key of D;</p>
        <p> &nbsp;D major scale, D, E, F#, G, A, B, C# &nbsp;D minor, (b3, b6, b7)D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">B|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">G|--------------------6--7--|--------------------5--7--</p>
<p class="tab">D|-----------5--7--9--------|-----------5--7--8--------</p>
<p class="tab">A|--5--7--9-----------------|--5--7--8-----------------</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
        <p>Now for the relative minor keys of the major keys we’ve learned about;</p>
        <p> &nbsp;E minor scale (Relative minor of G maj) &nbsp;B minor (Relative minor of D maj)</p>
<p class="tab">E|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">B|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">G|--------------------------|--------------------------</p>
<p class="tab">D|--------------------4--5--|--------------------3--5--</p>
<p class="tab">A|-----------3--5--7--------|-----------3--5--6--------</p>
<p class="tab">E|--3--5--7-----------------|--3--5--6-----------------</p>
        <p>Now, try creating some parallel minor scales, and then figuring out their relative 
majors with this concept.</p>
